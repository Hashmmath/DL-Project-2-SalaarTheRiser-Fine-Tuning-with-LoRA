This is the Git-Hub Repository of the Team - SalaarTheRiser for the Deep Learning Competition on Fine-Tuning with LoRA conducted in Kaggle and In this Repository I have included the Codebase in the form of a Jupyter Notebook File, and I have included Report as well.

Along with that I have also included the Project-2-Prediction-7.csv file which was our prediction on the competition which achieved an accuracy of 85.30%. Even when you run the code that is provided you will also achieve the same CSV file and gives the same prediction.

For reference I have also attached the questionnaire of the project provided by the professor and this is a ReadME file for explaining what exactly does this Repository Contains.
